# Summary

The data used in this study is a real-world dataset of junior high school grades 7 to 8 excavated from physics teaching resources such as textbooks, teaching aids, quiz questions, etc. It contains a total of 20,744 images spread
over 24 knowledge points such as Temperature, Density, Velocity, Pressure, Mass, Lens, etc.  These teaching images are manually annotated by a team of professional teachers in our collaborating company. To ensure annotation quality and consistency, three annotators, with specialized knowledge of physical disciplines, participated in the annotation task. The entire annotation proceeds
in a two-stage process, where each annotator independently label the entire dataset of 20744 images in stage 1, and each of the teaching images where the annotators do not have complete agreement is negotiated by all annotators to
determine the final knowledge point in stage 2. This process produces a high-quality physics teaching image dataset annotated with knowledge points. All the images are in JPG format. Due to the inconsistent size of images, each image
is resized to 224*224 pixels in the RGB color space.
